# Malnutrition - A Disease that No One Cares About

## Project Overview

Malnutrition is a critical global health issue that often goes unnoticed. This data analytics project aims to shed light on the prevalence and impact of malnutrition by utilizing the IBM Cognos Analytics platform. We have created insightful visualizations, dashboards, a compelling story, and a comprehensive report to raise awareness about this pressing concern. The project is also accessible through a website created with a frontend framework, and data cleaning was performed using MS Excel.
